# 🌐 Multi-Tenant, Multi-Branch School Management Platform – Fully Detailed (No AI for now)

Build a fully-featured Multi-Tenant, Multi-Branch School Management Platform that is:

1. Fully detailed, modular, Indian school-compliant (CBSE, ICSE, State Boards).
2. Multi-tenant and branch-aware (Platform → School Group → Branch hierarchy).
3. Subscription-controlled (Free, Basic, Premium, Custom), with branch-level plan enforcement.
4. Role-flexible with granular RBAC and field-level security for all modules.
5. Extensible for future AI, IoT, e-learning, gamification, analytics.

Requirements:

A) **Portals & Roles**:
   1. Platform Admin Portal (Super Admin)
   2. School Admin Portal (School Group / Trust Level)
   3. Branch Admin Portal (Principal / Branch Head)
   4. Staff Portal (Role-specific + Secondary Module Access)
   5. Teacher Portal
   6. Student Portal
   7. Parent Portal

B) **Features & Modules**:
   - All modules, submodules, workflows, and features as detailed in the text-based hierarchical tree.
   - Ensure branch-level subscription enforcement and auto-detection of new modules/features.
   - Flexible secondary module assignment for staff.
   - Comprehensive dashboards, reporting, analytics, notifications, and communication for each portal.
   - Indian school compliance: syllabus, exams, co-curriculars, hostel, transport, finance, library.
   - Billing, payments, compliance, and invoicing per branch and school group.
   - Inventory, facilities, transport, library, and hostel management at branch level.
   - Academic workflows: admissions, attendance, timetables, exams, grading, report cards, lesson plans, student promotions.
   - Role-based and field-level permissions for every module and record.
   - Support & escalation workflows for branch, school, and platform levels.

C) **Implementation Notes**:
   - Text-based hierarchical tree must be implemented exactly as defined.
   - Use modular architecture for ease of maintenance and scalability.
   - Do NOT include AI features at this stage; architecture should allow future AI integration.
   - Ensure responsive, user-friendly interfaces for all portals (admin, staff, teacher, student, parent).
   - Include multi-lingual support for Indian regional languages (i18n).
   - Provide documentation for each module, workflow, and role permission setup.

D) **Deliverables**:
   1. Full source code with modular structure.
   2. Configurable RBAC & subscription system.
   3. Fully functional portals for all roles.
   4. Developer documentation with module tree, feature descriptions, and workflow diagrams.
   5. Database schema design supporting multi-tenant, multi-branch hierarchy.
   6. Test cases covering core workflows for each portal.

**Reference:** Use the text-based visual tree provided as the complete blueprint for all portals, modules, submodules, and workflows.
